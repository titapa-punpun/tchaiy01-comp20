	<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, I have been given the client-side and server-side of the 2048 game modified by my partner, Ethan Chen. Unfortunately, the code has security and privacy vulnerabilities, and I have been hired as a security consultant to document and resolve the security and privacy issues in the applications.</p>

	<h2>Abstract of Findings</h2>

	<h2>Issues Found</h2>
		<h4>Issue</h4>
			<h5>Really bad programming practice.</h5>
		<h4>Location</h4>
			<h5>gamemanager.js: line 92</h5>
		<h4>Severity of Issue</h4>
			<h5>Medium Severity. Although this is technically not exactly a vulnerability, it is really bad programming practice because hard-coding username is extremely rigid and constrained.</h5>
		<h4>Description of Issue</h4>
			<h5>Hard-coding username is very inflexible because the username will always be "Ethan" in this case. It doesn't allow user to input his/her actual username because it will always default to the hard-coded username. Users are unable to save their scores to a unique name, which means it will be hard to identify which score belongs to which user since they are all "Ethan."</h5>

An XSS vulnerability arises when web applications take data from users and dynamically include it in web pages without first properly validating the data.

XSS vulnerabilities may occur if:
- Input coming into web applications is not validated
- Output to the browser is not HTML encoded
