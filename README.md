What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)
* To assess myself on what I've accomplished and how much I've grown in this 
  class


What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
* My favorite assignment was MBTA. This assignment introduced me to APIs and 
  gave me more awareness of the web and how different sites use different
  APIs. It really made me understand the concept of "don't reinvent the wheel."
  Because of the MBTA assignment, I am able to better understand how different
  sites pull information from something that's already been created and add
  onto what already exists. 
  

How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
* To be honest, not as much as I want to. I definitely know more about the web
  than I did on day 1, but I am still not confident in my knowledge and can 
  definitely get more familiar with it if I invest the time. 


What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
* Google Maps API
* Example 1: Things finally made sense after I learned how to use Google Maps
  API! All the restaurants and stores that pin their location on Google Maps 
  on their websites use Google Maps API to be able to do so. How did I never 
  discover this before taking the class when I've come across it pretty much
  everyday? 
* Example 2: Knowing Google Maps API doesn't just stop there, because there are
  other APIs too (this blew my mind). Youtube API, Spotify API, Instagram API,
  etc. exists too! Not having to reinvent the wheel is awesome! Because of the
  introduction to Google Maps API, our team is now using Spotify API to build
  our project. 


Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
* I want look more into the different APIs out there because they are so, so 
  cool. Having a good knowledge of what is out there will give me more insights
  into the different opportunities and availabilities out there, ones I may
  not be aware of currently.
