COMP20 Assignment 2: MBTA 


IMPLEMENTATION:
According to my knowledge, everything has been implemented correctly. My
style.css pasts the css file test, and my index.html pasts the html file test.

I use a 2D array to input all the stations and their information. I have 2 
arrays of dictionary (one for main path, the other for sub path when it
forks at JFK/UMass). Those 2 arrays of dictionary are only used to draw 
pathlines connecting all stations--nowhere else. 


COLLABORATION:
TA Rafel (helped with getting distance to closest station)
TA Michael Robinson (helped with loading schedule after data has been parsed)


TIME SPENT: 
Approximately 28 hours. For future assignments, I need to make sure I have
a conceptual idea of how to implement before diving into the code to save 
time.
